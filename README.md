# Intelligent Valet Design

This repository contains the system design document for an **Intelligent Valet Car Retrieval System** designed for a large mall with multiple entry and exit gates.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

In a real-world mall setting:
- Visitors can drop their car at any gate.
- They may exit from **any other gate** without specifying it in advance.
- The valet system must predict and deliver the car to the **correct gate** in time for pickup.

## ðŸ“„ Whatâ€™s Inside

The `Intelligent_Valet_System_Design.pdf` document covers:

- System architecture (app, backend, valet dashboard)
- Exit gate prediction logic (GPS, BLE beacons, Wi-Fi triangulation, motion tracking)
- Real-world constraint handling
- Diagrams and logical flow
